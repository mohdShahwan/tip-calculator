This repository contains my solution to the React State Management Challenge, which is part of the Udemy course by Jonas Schmedtmann. The challenge exercise focuses on state management and the usage of `props.children` in React.

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, we were tasked with building a React component that demonstrates effective state management using React's built-in features. The component should leverage the `props.children` pattern to create a flexible and reusable solution.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript

## Installation and Usage

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mohdShahwan/react-state-management-challenge.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-state-management-challenge`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## Challenge Solution

In my solution, I focused on implementing a robust state management system using React's hooks and context API. I divided the challenge into smaller components to keep the code modular and maintainable. By using `props.children`, I made the component versatile and easily configurable.

The solution demonstrates the following concepts:

- Setting up and managing state using React hooks.
- Propagating state and functions down the component tree using context.
- Utilizing `props.children` to render dynamic content within the component.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different use cases. The comments within the code provide explanations and insights into the implementation.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to Jonas Schmedtmann for creating the React course on Udemy and providing this challenging exercise. It has been an excellent opportunity for me to enhance my understanding of state management in React.

Thank you for visiting this repository and reviewing my solution!
